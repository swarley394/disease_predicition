      <h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>
    People are often more cautious about the beauty of their hands than their feet. They invest in good salons and get expensive manicures, as their hands are more visible. Feet on the other hand are easier to neglect and not take care of.
However, in recent years, pedicures have grown more popular and people have been spending money on these. In addition to pedicures that are easily accessible and budget-friendly, you can even set up your own home foot spa.
