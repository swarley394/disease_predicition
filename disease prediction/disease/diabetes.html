      <h2>Diseases </h2>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide and has become a growing public health concern. This disease is characterised by high blood sugar levels resulting from the body’s inability to produce or use insulin effectively. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose uptake into cells, providing them with energy.</p> <br>
<p>There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes.

    <br> <br>Type 1 diabetes, formerly known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This form of diabetes typically develops in childhood or adolescence but can also occur in adults.
    <br> Type 2 diabetes, previously called adult-onset or non-insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of the disease. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. While it is more prevalent in adults, an increasing number of children and adolescents are being diagnosed due to rising obesity rates.</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p><li>Insulin injections: Individuals with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections multiple times a day. Different types of insulin vary in their onset, peak, and duration of action, and a combination of short-acting and long-acting insulin is often used to manage blood sugar levels effectively.</li>
    <li> Artificial pancreas: Also known as a closed-loop insulin delivery system, this technology combines an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor to automatically adjust insulin delivery based on blood sugar levels.</li>
<li>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): CGM devices measure blood sugar levels in real-time throughout the day and night, helping individuals with Type 1 diabetes make informed decisions about insulin doses and other aspects of their diabetes management.</li></p>

    <section id="Symptoms">
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of Diabetes</p> <br>
      <p><li>Frequent urination: The kidneys work to remove excess glucose from the blood, resulting in increased urine production.<br></li>
        <li>Excessive thirst: Increased urination leads to dehydration, causing an unquenchable thirst. <br></li>
        <li>Fatigue and weakness: As the body is unable to utilise glucose for energy, individuals with Type 1 diabetes may experience constant tiredness and lack of energy.<br></li>
        <li>Slow-healing sores or infections: High blood sugar levels can impair the body’s ability to heal wounds and fight infections. <br></li>
        <li>Tingling or numbness in hands and feet: Prolonged high blood sugar levels can damage nerves, causing tingling, numbness, or pain in the extremities.<br></li>
        <li>Increased hunger: The inability to use glucose effectively for energy may cause constant hunger, even after eating. <br></li> </p>
