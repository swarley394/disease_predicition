      <h2>Disease </h2>
      <p>Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, previously called background retinopathy, is the earliest stage of diabetic eye disease. Microscopic changes occur in the blood vessels of the eye in non-proliferative disease; however, the changes typically do not produce symptoms and are not visible to the naked eye. Non-proliferative disease progresses from mild to moderate to severe.</p><br>
        <p>Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is initially characterised by microaneurysms (microscopic blood-filled bulges in the artery walls) which may burst and leak into the retina. Tiny spots or dots of blood may accumulate in the retina, but they usually do not produce noticeable symptoms in the early stages of the disease. As the disease progresses, hard exudates (accumulations of fluid that has leaked from blood vessels), abnormalities in the growth of microscopic blood vessels in the retina, and bleeding from the veins that feed the retina may occur. <br></p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Non-proliferative disease is asymptomatic, and treatment aims to slow progression to proliferative sight-threatening disease and reduce the risk of macular oedema occurring as a complication. Adequate control of blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol minimise the chances of disease progression and are the key measures taken to manage individuals with diabetic retinopathy. Adequate control is typically achieved using dietary interventions and medications. For example, high blood pressure may be managed using beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.</p>

    <section id="Symptoms">
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy has no obvious symptoms until the disease progresses to proliferative type and major bleeding in the retina occurs, causing irreversible vision loss. In the early stages, diabetic retinopathy can only be identified by an eye examination, conducted by a professional (who may be a general practitioner or an eye specialist like an ophthalmologist).
It is therefore important for diabetics to have their eyes examined regularly, so that retinopathic changes can be identified in the early stages, and steps take to prevent irreversible vision loss. Treatments for diabetic retinopathy can help prevent future vision loss, but they are not effective in restoring vision that is already lost.
