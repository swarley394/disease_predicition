      <h2>Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
      <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, causing memory loss and cognitive decline. As the disease advances, it becomes increasingly challenging for patients and their families to navigate daily life.

        <p><h3> <b>What Is Alzheimer’s Disease? </b></h3><br>
        Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia characterised by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities, including memory, thinking, and reasoning skills. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for up to 80% of cases. Alzheimer’s is a neurodegenerative disease, which means that it causes the death of brain cells over time, leading to a reduction in brain size and function.</p>
