      <h2>Disease </h2>
      <p>Chronic daily headache is a type of frequently occurring headache which may be further classified as
        either:</p><br>
        <p><li>Chronic migraine, previously known as transformed migraine, is a condition where episodic migraine-type headaches occur more frequently until the individual experiences a migraine on ?15 days per month; or</li> <br></p>
    <p><li>Medication overuse headache, which refers to a headache syndrome in which an individual who previously experienced episodic primary headaches does so with increasing frequency, and is unable to achieve appropriate pain relief with normal medication doses. Medication use thus increases and, paradoxically, contributes to headache pain.</li><br></p>

    <section id="Treatment">
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Prophylactic treatment, that is the use of preventative medications for chronic migraine (without medication overuse) aims to reduce the frequency of acute attacks, lessen the impairment the individuals experience during an attack and reduce the use of acute medication. Most of the medications used in migraine prophylaxis (e.g. ?-blockers, anticonvulsants, and tricyclic antidepressants) have not been evaluated for efficacy in treating chronic migraine, however they are commonly used and considered effective in clinical practice.</p>

    <section id="Symptoms">
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>When a person attends a doctorâ€™s office with headache symptoms suggestive of chronic daily headache, the doctor will conduct a thorough clinical history assessment, with the aim of distinguishing chronic daily headaches from other possible headache diagnoses. Some causes of headache are life-threatening and require urgent treatment and it is important to exclude these conditions. Once the diagnosis of chronic daily headache is made, the doctor will determine whether the diagnosis is chronic migraine (no medication overuse) or medication overuse headache.</p>
