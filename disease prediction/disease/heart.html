      <h2>Diseases </h2>
      <p>Heart disease, a term that encompasses a wide array of cardiovascular conditions, affects millions of people worldwide and is the leading cause of death across the globe. These conditions target the heart and blood vessels, resulting in a variety of symptoms and complications that can range from mild discomfort to life-threatening emergencies.</p> <br> <br>
        <p>The complexity of heart disease stems from its multifaceted nature, which can involve issues with the heart’s structure, function, rhythm, or the blood vessels that supply it. Early detection, proper treatment, and risk factor management are essential for improving outcomes and reducing the impact of heart disease on individuals and society. This comprehensive article will delve into the various types of heart disease, their symptoms, and when to seek medical assistance, providing a foundation for understanding this pervasive and critical health issue.</p>

      <p>Types of Heart Disease Problems</p> <br>
      <p><b>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):</b> Coronary artery disease is caused by the buildup of plaque, a mixture of cholesterol, fatty substances, calcium, and other materials, on the inner walls of the coronary arteries. This process, called atherosclerosis, can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle, depriving it of oxygen and nutrients. </p> <br>
    <p><b>Heart Arrhythmias: </b> There are several types of heart arrhythmias, which can be classified based on their origin (atria or ventricles) and speed (bradycardia or tachycardia). Some common arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. </p> <br>
    <p><b> Heart Failure:</b>There are two primary types of heart failure: systolic and diastolic. Systolic heart failure occurs when the heart’s left ventricle cannot contract effectively, while diastolic heart failure is characterised by the inability of the left ventricle to relax and fill with blood properly. </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of a Heart Attack</p> <br>
<p>A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked. The symptoms can vary and may include:</p> <br>
      <p><li>Chest pain or discomfort, which may feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or a burning sensation<br></li>
        <li>Pain or discomfort in the arms, neck, jaw, stomach, or back <br></li>
        <li>Shortness of breath, even at rest or during mild activity <br></li>
        <li>Cold sweat, nausea, or vomiting <br></li>
        <li>Light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting<br></li>
