      <h2>Disease </h2>
      <p>Parkinson’s disease was first recognised in the 1800s by the man who the disease is named after, and he actually made the diagnosis by simply observing people in the street. Subsequently we’ve been able to determine that it is due to a loss of brain cells, in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. Where is that? It’s in the base of the brain, in the brainstem. It contains cells that produce dopamine. They’re part of a network called the basal ganglia, which is involved in spontaneous and voluntary movement.</p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>So when talking about treatment of Parkinson’s disease it’s important not to forget the non-drug approaches. This includes various forms of exercise or physical therapies. I generally refer patients to programs that are more evidence based, which there are numerous. But essentially it’s not as simple as going out and having a daily walk. There are focused physiotherapist or exercise physiologist-based programs that have been proven to improve patient symptoms, delay the need to start treatment, enhance the effects of medication and other treatments that they are on. So that’s one avenue for treatment.</p>

    <section id="Symptoms">
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>The first symptoms can be something obvious like a tremor. A tremor is a shaking of the part of the body that’s first affected. It’s typically on one side, it’s typically in the hand, or there can be different presentations. If tremor is the first symptom, it’s often diagnosed early.

        The other main symptoms are slowness of movement or bradykinesia, and rigidity which is something we feel – patients don’t necessarily notice it, but it can look like or feel like stiffness, usually in the limb or the back.</p>
